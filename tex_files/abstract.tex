Initially a theory, nowadays fuzzy logic has become an operational technique.
Used alongside other advanced techniques, it is making a discrete but appreciated appearance in many fields of computer science.
Together with Artificial Neural Networks they are able to create powerful systems when used properly.
This paper intends to present basics of fuzzy logic and aritficial neural networks in theory and will try to present a way of using both of them in one system - Fuzzy Neural Network.
